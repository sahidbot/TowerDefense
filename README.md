# TowerDefense

This is a Team project at Concordia University for the course SOEN6441 - Advanced Programming Practices (Winter 2016) given by Dr. Joey Paquet (http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~paquet/ as of on 08-Apr-2016). We adopted extreme programming practices and agile methodologies. Finally, we had three different delivery deadlines enhancing iterative process having 3 builds with different requirements. 

Our game has 4 different windows, two that follow the MVC architecture and two that are implemented using our own game framework with a game architecture.  We implemented the Singleton, Observer, Strategy and Factory patterns to meet different requirements. Finally, we wrote unit tests to test different portions of the game.
